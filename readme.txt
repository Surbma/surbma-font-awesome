Font Awesome - The iconic font and CSS toolkit

== Description ==

With this plugin you can use the iconic font and CSS toolkit, the Font Awesome icons. It is loading the css and the font files from the MaxCDN network, which means super fast loading, wherever your visitors are on this planet.

You get also a very useful shortcode to use icons on your site:
`[fa class="fa-camera-retro"]`

As you can see, you only need to add the icon name, that's it. Isn't it awesome? If you use the `<i class="fa fa-camera-retro"></i>` code, the WordPress editor will remove it, because it is an empty code, which "should be removed". So with this shortcode, you can use the Font Awesome icons wherever you want.
